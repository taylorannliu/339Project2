                <h3>Our well-raised chickens enjoying the sun.</h3>

                <p>PoultryPal is committed to raising friendly chickens in hopes that they end up in a safe and loving home.  
            
                    <br><br>PoultryPal began as a small project from a small family of chicken farmers. After becoming comfortable raising the chickens, we soon grew a liking towards them and then quickly became fond of them. Over the years, our tiny chicken coop grew and grew into a home for tens of chickens. We realized that many of these lovely cluckers deserved a forever home elsewhere â€” somewhere else to spread their love. 

                    <br><br>That thought is what inspired the beginnings of PoultryPal, a family-run chicken adoption business that has been bringing joy to British Columbia, Canada for the past 20 years (and more to come). We love connecting people to our wonderful cluckers and bringing light to the community in a unique way.</p>
